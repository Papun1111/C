// Here's a breakdown of how the function pointer is used in your example:

// Declaration: int (*p)(int) = f; declares a function pointer named p that is intended to point to functions taking an int as an argument and returning an int. The pointer is initialized to point to the function f.

// Calling the Function via Pointer: (*p)(8); uses the function pointer p to call the function f with 8 as the argument. The syntax (*p)(8) is correct and required to denote that p is a pointer to a function which needs to be dereferenced before calling.

// This method is syntactically correct and does what is intended, but if you are just calling a function directly in simple scenarios, using the function name directly (e.g., f(8);) is simpler and clearer. Function pointers add an extra level of indirection that is useful in specific contexts but might be overkill for straightforward function calls.

// So, while the method in your code is correct, whether it's the "right" way depends on the context and goals of your code. In many cases, especially when learning or writing very straightforward, procedural code, calling the function directly without a pointer is preferred for clarity.
